Try deleting them again, if some of them can't be deleted because it's being used by another process...
No problem! try this:

Rename them with a random name and move them to your desktop, or documents, or to a folder of your choice...

Now, you can move the files from NEW_CODECS_EXTRACTED_FROM_22xxx.xxxx to the System32 folder.
Reboot your computer and delete the files you moved to your desktop or whatever folder you saved them. :)
