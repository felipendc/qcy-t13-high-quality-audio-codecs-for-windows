Try deleting them again, if some of them can't be deleted because another process is using these files...
No problem! Do this:

Rename them with a random name and move them to your desktop, or documents, or whatever folder...

Now, you can move the files from NEW_CODECS_EXTRACTED_FROM_22635.2915 to System32 folder.
Reboot your computer and delete the files you moved to your desktop or whatever folder you saved theme. :)
